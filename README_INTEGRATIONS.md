# Integrations (Push Sync)

## UpCoach webhook
Paste your unique webhook URL in **Integrations**.
Events sent:
- `test` (via button)
- `task.created`
- `task.completed`
- `push.sync` (manual PUSH SYNC)

Payloads include: business name, year, basic summary, and task details when relevant.

## Calendly
Paste any Calendly Event link; the app surfaces it in **PUSH SYNC** for easy sharing.

## Email
If SMTP is configured, selecting **EMAIL** under **PUSH SYNC** sends an HTML payload summary to the recipients you specify.
